# Final Project

This project was created to analyze RFM model-based and customer segmentation of UK-based and Registered Non-Store Online Retail.

## Introduction

Businesses all over the world are growing every day. With the help of technology, they have access to a wider market and hence, a large customer base. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

Customer segmentation is the process of separating customers into groups on the basis of their shared behavior or other attributes. The customer segmentation is an effective method that enables to get better know clients and to better correspond, their various needs. Almost every company that sells products or services stores data of shopping. This type of data can be used to execute customer segmentation thus, the results of the analysis can be translated into marketing campaigns to increase sales. One of the most widely used techniques is RFM analysis, which allows to create personalized special offers to improve sales.

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value and it is the technique of customer segmentation based on their transaction history. The RFM analysis is based on three criterias, which measure different customer characteristics:

- Recency: Days since last purchase/order of the client;
- Frequency: Total number of purchases the customer were made;
- Monetary Value: Total money the customer spent per order.
