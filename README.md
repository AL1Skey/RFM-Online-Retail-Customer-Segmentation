# Final Project

This project aims to identify customer segments on a transnational data set for a UK-based online retail.

## Introduction

Businesses all over the world are growing every day. With the help of technology, they have access to a wider market and hence, a large customer base. This is a transnational dataset which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

Customer segmentation is the process of separating customers into groups on the basis of their shared behavior or other attributes. The customer segmentation is an effective method that enables to get better know clients and to better correspond, their various needs. Almost every company that sells products or services stores data of shopping. This type of data can be used to execute customer segmentation thus, the results of the analysis can be translated into marketing campaigns to increase sales. One of the most widely used techniques is RFM analysis, which allows to create personalized special offers to improve sales.

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value and it is the technique of customer segmentation based on their transaction history. The RFM analysis is based on three criterias, which measure different customer characteristics:

- Recency: Days since last purchase/order of the client;
- Frequency: Total number of purchases the customer were made;
- Monetary Value: Total money the customer spent per order.

## Problem Statement

In this project, our task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

### A. The Need of Customer Segmentation

The differences in customers' behaviour, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with following:

- Target Marketing
- Client understanding
- Optimal product placement
- Revenue growth

### B. Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) Model to Determine Customer Value

The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

- Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?
- Frequency – How often do they purchase?
- Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.

### C. Approach Taken

- Data Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Create RFM model
- Implementing Clustering Models and Validating
